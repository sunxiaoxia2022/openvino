**OpenVINO™ integration with TensorFlow** is a solution for TensorFlow developers who want to get started with OpenVINO™ in their inferencing applications. By adding just two lines of code you can now take advantage of OpenVINO™ toolkit optimizations with TensorFlow inference applications across a range of Intel® computation devices.

This is all you need:

.. code-block:: bash

   import openvino_tensorflow
   openvino_tensorflow.set_backend('<backend_name>')


**OpenVINO™ integration with TensorFlow** accelerates inference across many AI models on a variety of Intel® technologies, such as:

* Intel® CPUs
* Intel® integrated GPUs

.. note:: 
   For maximum performance, efficiency, tooling customization, and hardware control, we recommend developers to adopt native OpenVINO™ solutions.

To find out more about the product itself, as well as learn how to use it in your project, check its dedicated `GitHub repository <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_tensorflow/tree/master/docs>`__. 


To see what you can do with **OpenVINO™ integration with TensorFlow**, explore the demos located in the `examples folder <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_tensorflow/tree/master/examples>`__ in our GitHub repository.  

Sample tutorials are also hosted on `Intel® DevCloud <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/devcloud/edge/build/ovtfoverview.html>`__. The demo applications are implemented using Jupyter Notebooks. You can interactively execute them on Intel® DevCloud nodes, compare the results of **OpenVINO™ integration with TensorFlow**, native TensorFlow, and OpenVINO™.
